# How to update office ui fabric stylings #

* Download latest release from https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core/releases

* Find the fabric.css (or fabric.min.css) from the release and copy paste the whole file into fabric.styl

# But why? #

As far as we know, there is no way of getting the same files via npm. The office-ui-fabric-core package only includes the scss files.

# Current version #

Current version is fabric 7.1.0
